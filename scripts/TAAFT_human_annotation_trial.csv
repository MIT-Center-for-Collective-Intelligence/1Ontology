Its implicit definition involves providing a 'computer or other machine' with instructions for 'automatic performance,' which directly aligns with the core meaning of 'Automate'. While related nodes like 'Design' or 'Plan' are part of the broader process of automation, they are too general. 'Program (computer)' captures the specific, core action of implementing automation, making it the best fit in terms of coverage, specificity, and semantic similarity.","The action 'conduct outreach' is a proactive effort to provide information to a specific audience.

This action of capturing audible information is most precisely described by the ontology node ""Record sound"". While the app also performs other actions like storing, analyzing, and transforming information, these are subsequent features that depend on the initial act of recording. The node ""Record sound"" is the most specific choice that fully covers the app's primary application, making it more suitable than broader categories like ""Record"" or ""Store information"".",,Organize,structure thoughts,"The application provides a 'place to dump your thoughts'. This act of capturing and storing information (voicenotes) is a classic meta-activity. It organizes raw input to facilitate a subsequent, substantive activity like writing, planning, or problem-solving, rather than performing that end activity itself.",The substantive activity is the cognitive work the user is performing. The tagline 'dump your thoughts' directly points to the user's need to process and manage their ideas. 'Structure thoughts' is the base 'verb + object' that describes this underlying mental task that the app is built to support.,Organize,Organize,"The input verb 'Organize' is polysemous, referring to the arrangement of information, physical objects, or people/events. The ontology contains three relevant nodes capturing these different senses: one for organizing information (under 'Reason'), one for organizing people/activities (under 'Control'), and one for arranging physical objects (under 'Arrange'). Of the two nodes with the exact title 'Organize', the one located under 'Act on information (‚ÄúThink‚Äù)' -> 'Create information' -> 'Reason' is selected as the best general fit. Its context among other core cognitive actions ('Copy', 'Consider', 'Process') is more fundamental and broadly applicable than the other 'Organize' node, which is situated within the more specific, managerial context of 'Control' and 'Get service'. Therefore, the selected node best represents the primary, context-free meaning of the verb.","The input verb phrase ""structure thoughts"" describes the mental act of arranging ideas into a coherent system. The node `Organize`, located under the path `Act on information (‚ÄúThink‚Äù) -> Create information -> Reason`, perfectly encapsulates this action. 
 1. **Coverage**: ""Organizing"" is a direct synonym for ""structuring"" in this context, and ""thoughts"" are a form of information that one reasons with. The node's scope fully covers the action.
 2. **Specificity**: `Organize` is more specific and fitting than its parent nodes like `Reason` or `Create information`. Other potential candidates like `Plan` or `Analyze` are too narrow, as they describe specific purposes for structuring thoughts (i.e., for future action or for detailed examination). The action of structuring thoughts is a general cognitive task that is best captured by `Organize`.
 3. **Similarity**: The title `Organize` has a high semantic similarity to the verb ""structure"". The hierarchical context within the ontology (`Act on information`, `Reason`) strongly supports the interpretation of this node as a cognitive, information-based activity."

 1. **Coverage**: 'Design' fully covers the conceptual work of automation. To automate something is to design an automated process for it. This node is located under 'Plan' and 'Create information', which correctly frames automation as a cognitive, planning-oriented activity.
 
 2. **Specificity**: 'Design' is at the correct level of specificity. It is more specific than its parent 'Plan', but more general than nodes like 'Program (computer)', which describes a specific method of implementation and would not cover mechanical automation. Other potential candidates like 'Operate' or 'Regulate' describe what the automated system *does* after it has been created, not the act of creating the automation itself.
 
 3. **Similarity**: The concept of designing a system is highly similar to automating it. The path to 'Design' within the ontology is logical, whereas other semantically similar nodes like 'Control' are located under paths related to social interaction ('Act with other actors'), making them contextually inappropriate for automating inanimate systems or processes.",

The hierarchical path for `Make available` (`Act` -> `Act how?` -> `Transfer` -> `Transfer out` -> `Provide` -> `Provide how?` -> `Supply` -> `Make available`) is also a very logical fit for the action of enabling something for others to use.","The input verb is 'analyze', which directly corresponds to the 'Analyze' node in the ontology. This node is appropriately situated under 'Act on information (‚ÄúThink‚Äù)' and 'Create information', reflecting that analysis is a cognitive process that generates new insights from existing data.

The phrase 'consolidate data' explicitly states that the end user is performing the substantive activity of managing their data, which this application facilitates.",Combine,Act on information (‚ÄúThink‚Äù),"The verb 'Integrate' has a core meaning of 'to combine'. The node 'Combine' is the best semantic match available in the ontology. It is chosen over more specific nodes like 'Combine physical objects' or 'Assemble' because 'Integrate' is an abstract verb that can apply to non-physical domains (e.g., data, systems), and these specific nodes fail the coverage criterion by being limited to physical objects. It is chosen over broader parent nodes like 'Modify' because it is more specific and more proximal to the primary action, as per the selection criteria. While the ontology only lists a physical specialization for 'Combine', the parent node itself is abstract and provides the best balance of full coverage and specificity for the input verb.","The action of ""managing data"" is a broad, ongoing process that encompasses all the specializations of `Act on information (‚ÄúThink‚Äù)`, namely `Create information`, `Modify information`, `Store information`, and `Transfer information`. No single one of these specializations is broad enough to cover the full scope of ""manage"". While more specific nodes like `Organize` or `Process` exist, they are nested under `Create information`, which incorrectly limits their scope to only the creation phase of data management, thus failing the coverage criterion. Therefore, `Act on information (‚ÄúThink‚Äù)` is the most specific node in the provided ontology that fully covers the multifaceted nature of data management."
